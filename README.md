# Zambia 

This repository is used to support ongoing research on the environmental effects of sugar cane production in Zambia. 
Annual ET totals during the pre-expansion (2006-2007) and post-expansion of sugar cane fields (2011-2012) are compared. 
All fields which were converted to sugar cane from nonsugar cane are analyzed and are separated into the following land use transition categories: 
<br><br>
Always cane (all exisiting cane fields - includes fields that switched irrigation techniques, ie: non center pivot to center pivot) <br>
Crop to cane (includes grains) <br>
Shrub to cane (shrubs) <br>
Unknown to cane (all unidentified expanded lands - assumed to originally be noncane)<br><br>
Forest to cane (forested and small trees)<br>
Grass to cane (includes grazed lands) <br>
Residential to cane<br>
Kascol Boundary

Includes: use of Mod16 ET and Mod13 NDVI maps, use of crop coefficient ("Kc") values. 

R scripts, excel spreadsheets in repository.
