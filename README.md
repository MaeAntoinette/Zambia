# Zambia 

This repository is used to support ongoing research on the environmental effects of sugar cane production in Zambia. 
Annual ET totals during the pre-expansion (2006-2007) and post-expansion of sugar cane fields (2011-2012) are compared. 
All fields which were converted to sugar cane from nonsugar cane are analyzed and are separated into the following categories: 
<br><br>
Crop to cane (includes grains) <br>
Forest to cane (forested and small trees)<br>
Shrub to cane (shrubs) <br>
Grass to cane (includes grazed lands) <br>
Unknown to cane (all unidentified expanded lands - assumed to originally be noncane)<br><br>

Always cane (all exisiting cane fields - includes fields that switched irrigation techniques, ie: non center pivot to center pivot) <br>
Crop to crop (non sugar cane conversion) <br>
Crop to fallow (non sugar cane conversion) <br>
Cane to fallow (non sugar cane conversion) <br>
